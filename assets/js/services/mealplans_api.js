//for now I will create a sample mealplanUserData, later it should be recieved frow landing

// Callories division is: 18% for breakfast, 30% for lunch, 30% for dinner, 11% for snack 1, 11% for snack 2.
// Range for each meal would be 10% of the callories per meal. For example we have 2000 cals per day, so its 600 cals for lunch and the range would be 540-660 cals for lunch

const mealplanUserData = {
    calloriesPerDay: "2000",
    preferences: ["pork-free", "peanut-free", "fish-free"],

// mealplan will be updated daily
const date = new Date();
const currentDateString =
    date.getFullYear() + "-" + (date.getMonth() + 1) + "-" + date.getDate();
